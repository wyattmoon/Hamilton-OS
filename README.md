# Hamilton-OS
GNOME but without systemd, but can run Debian files. Experimenting this with Ubuntu 23.04, but note that if you have Broadcom drivers apply them using either the Additional Drivers program, or use a USB (Internet Gateway) available at most electronic stores. You can also use this to modify, as I am a big fan of Linux and uses it.
